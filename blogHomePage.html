          <p>
            I love seeing all of the different types of <b>Kaiju</b> and their
            abilitis. With movies like Suicide Squad, Godzilla Vs. Kong, Pacific
            Rim, or even popular animes, this sub-genre of japanese depiction is
            beginning to permeate its way to western audiences. This blog is
            dedicated to collecting the various <b>Kaijus</b> and listing out
            some rad facts about them. I hope you enjoy!
          </p>

            which are usually depicted attacking major cities and engaging the
            military, or other Pictured: in battle.</blockquote>
